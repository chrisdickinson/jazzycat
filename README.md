JazzyCat
========
1. this is not done yet, so don't use it yet.
2. this is very proof-of-concept.
3. it's named "jazzycat" because of its connection to django and nappingcat. yes, it is a dumb name.
4. the idea is to run this on a webserver, and run the nappingcat thing as a separate user. the webserver user has a SSH private/public key that's associated
with an admin account in nappingcat, and it's the only one that can create or modify users.
5. theoretically, you could keep the nappingcat server and the webserver separated completely and have them talk to the same DB.
6. i'm not sure exactly why you would want to do this, except maybe to show off to your friends.
7. but on the other hand, if you're looking to show off to your friends, you probably chose the wrong career.
8. i mean, seriously, if you had chosen to be a professional skateboarder or a chef or something, you might have a better chance
of impressing your friends.
9. or like, some sort of totally sweet dracula dude. i'm not sure.
10. but programming isn't really the venue for that. so don't try and show off.
